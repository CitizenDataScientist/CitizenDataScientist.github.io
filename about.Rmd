### Bio

I'm Miguel, a `r floor(interval(ymd("1993-06-08"), today()) / years(1))`-year-old Mechanical Engineer with a strong passion for data analytics and visualization, process modeling and simulation. 

Having majored in Control Systems, Industrial Automation and Robotics, I developed a keen affinity for uncovering insights from data during my MSc degree (obtained from Instituto Superior Tecnico in 2017), an interest that I further explored throughout my Erasmus exchange program at RWTH Aachen (_sommersemester_ 2016), taking elective courses on applied statistics and machine learning.

I am currently based in Lisbon, working as a Data Scientist for a renowned pharmaceutical CDMO. As part of my role within the team, I am accountable for:

* Process mapping - covering people, material and information flows;
* Consolidating data from different systems, establishing new data pipelines and integration services;
* Conducting _ad hoc_ analysis, developing prototype models and proof of concept applications;
* Developing and maintaining a suite of automated reporting tools, process monitoring dashboards and forecasting models;
* Devising new process governance policies, covering roles and responsibilities for data management and best-practice operational procedures;
* Gathering requirements, leading the procurement and overseeing the implementation of innovative industrial informatics software products and hardware solutions; 

<!-- * Developing an understanding of business processes, together with project stakeholders and subject matter experts; -->

The languages I use the most are portuguese, **`R`**, **`SQL`**, english, **`pyhton`** and **`node.js`** - in that order.

Enough of work.

I travel whenever I get the chance, with a pronounced tendency to keep heading North - from hunting down coffee shops, tap rooms and restaurants in big metropolis to delving into secluded nature retreats. I enjoy swimming and indoor climbing, taking my car for a drive along the coast while listening to music and playing jams on my bass.

### This Blog 

I decided to start this blog as a way to document my learning process while practicing exploratory analysis and modelling workflows. Two types of posts will be published:

* **Longform:** presented as investigative journalism pieces, aimed at people who want to discover more about the world through data. No code will be featured on theses posts, favouring a storytelling approach weaved upon a data-driven narrative.
* **Scribbles:** shorter posts focused on promoting data literacy, where I will explore new packages and APIs while featuring code snippets that can be adapted by the readers to reproduce the analysis on their own.
